Shairport Packaging Scripts for Debian
======================================

Packaging scripts to make [shairport](https://github.com/abrasive/shairport) DEB for Debian systems. Why bother?
So that it's easy to get onto a Raspberry Pi (which runs Debian)
without too much pain and suffering or having to install a compiler &
other tools on the Pi.
